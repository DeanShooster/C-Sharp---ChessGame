<h2 align="center">About The Application </h2>
A basic example of a object oriented game design - Chess.

It is built with C#.
The application relies on object orient design meaning each chess piece is an object by itself and are connected by the object game itself.
The game is ongoing on the C# console but can be easily duplicated to another system.
